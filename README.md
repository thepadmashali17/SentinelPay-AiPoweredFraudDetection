# SentinelPay – AI-Powered Fraud Detection Platform

SentinelPay is an end-to-end **FinTech fraud detection platform** that demonstrates how machine learning models are integrated into real-world systems using backend APIs, interactive dashboards, and compliance-aware design.

Rather than focusing only on model accuracy, this project emphasizes:
- Explainability (XAI)
- Scalability
- Production-style system architecture
- Regulatory and compliance awareness

---

## What Does SentinelPay Do?

SentinelPay assesses whether a financial transaction is potentially fraudulent by analyzing behavioral and contextual signals.

### Input
Users provide transaction-related details such as:
- Transaction amount
- Time since last transaction
- Transaction frequency
- Merchant risk score

### Output
The system returns:
- **Fraud Probability Score** – numerical likelihood of fraud
- **Risk Classification** – `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`

This project simulates how fraud detection models are deployed, consumed, and explained in modern financial ecosystems.

## System Architecture Overview

1. User / Transaction Input  
2. Frontend Dashboard – Streamlit-based UI  
3. Backend API – FastAPI service  
4. Fraud Detection Engine – ML logic (Scikit-Learn)  
5. Risk Scoring & Decision  
6. Blockchain Audit Layer (Design Proposal) – Immutable compliance logs

## Machine Learning Overview

### Dataset
- Credit card transaction dataset with severe class imbalance
- Fraudulent transactions form a very small minority

### Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling and feature engineering
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Random Forest classifier
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Precision–Recall focused evaluation metrics

### Explainability (XAI)
- Feature importance analysis
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Designed with regulatory transparency in mind

---

## Backend API (FastAPI)

### Available Endpoints
- `GET /` – Health check
- `POST /predict` – Fraud risk prediction

### Sample Request
```json
{
  "amount": 4500,
  "time_since_last_txn": 120,
  "txn_count_1hr": 6,
  "merchant_risk": 0.8
}
```

---

## Frontend Dashboard (Streamlit)

The Streamlit dashboard allows users to:
- Enter transaction details
- Submit real-time prediction requests
- View fraud probability and risk classification instantly

---

## Blockchain Audit Layer (Design Intent)

To support compliance and trust, SentinelPay proposes a blockchain-based audit layer.

### Purpose
- Immutable fraud decision logs
- Tamper-proof audit trails
- Regulatory readiness

### Key Design Principle
- No raw transaction or personal data stored on-chain
- Only hashed metadata and fraud decision summaries are recorded

This layer is documented but not deployed, reflecting realistic FinTech adoption practices.
